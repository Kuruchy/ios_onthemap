OnTheMap iOS App - Project for the iOS Developer Nanodegree at Udacity

A way to share Links between Udacity users. The map will contain pins that show the location where other students have reported studying. By tapping on the pin users can see a URL for something the student finds interesting. The user will be able to add their own data by posting a string that can be geocoded to a location, and a URL.
